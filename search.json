    "text": "1.1 Quality vs. quantity\nWhile we will dive into many algorithms over the course of this book, I want to drive home that machine learning models need data to learn. We can have the fanciest neural network on the best GPU cluster in the world, but without data, it’s all pointless. To drive this point home let’s see some machine learning in action.\nWe’ll start with a line. Nothing special, just the equation f(x) = x + 1.\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsns.set_theme(style=\"darkgrid\")\n\n\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"Function that applies `x + 1` to `x`.\"\"\"\n    return x + 1\n\ndef get_y(xs):\n    \"\"\"Return `y` for every `x` in the list `xs`.\"\"\"\n    return list(map(f, xs))\n\n\nx = [-1, 1]\ny = get_y(x)\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=y)\nimport random\nimport pandas as pd\n\nrandom.seed(100392)\n\n\ndef random_x(n):\n    \"\"\"Return `n` random values from -1 to 1.\"\"\"\n    return [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(n)]\n\n\nxs = random_x(2)\nys = get_y(xs)\nsns.scatterplot(x=xs, y=ys)\nVisually, we could draw a line from dot to dot and we’d get the same line in the previous plot. But we’re not interested in figuring out the line ourselves. We’re here to have machine learning do it for us. This is already integrated into seaborn so there’s not much code for us to write. The regplot function will plot our data points and use machine learning to fit a line to those data points.\nsns.regplot(x=xs, y=ys, truncate=False, ci=False)\nWill you look at that! The line was perfectly predicted based on the data points.\nBut real world data isn’t this simple or this clean. There’s usually some amount of noise in the data that can affect the quality of predictions. Noise is randomness introduced to the data. It can come from many places like imprecise measurements, mislabelling, or unaccounted variables to name a few.\nNow let’s imagine we don’t have points on the line, but points close to the line. How will this change the predicted line?\n# Add noise to the data points to simulate noisy data.\ndef noisy_process(xs, noise):\n    \"\"\"Return `f(x)` with noise.\"\"\"\n    return [\n        y + random.uniform(-noise, noise)\n        for x, y in zip(xs, get_y(xs))\n    ]\n\n\nys_noisy = noisy_process(xs, 0.25)\n\nax = sns.regplot(\n    x=xs,\n    y=ys,\n    truncate=False,\n    ci=False,\n    scatter_kws={\"alpha\": 0.5},\n)\nsns.regplot(\n    x=xs,\n    y=ys_noisy,\n    truncate=False,\n    ci=False,\n    ax=ax,\n    scatter_kws={\"alpha\": 0.5},\n)\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndef simulate_n(n, n_points, noise):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a `pd.DataFrame` with `n` separate simulations\n    of `n_points`.\n    \"\"\"\n    data = []\n    real_x = [-1, 1]\n    real_y = get_y(real_x)\n    for x, y in zip(real_x, real_y):\n        data.append(\n            {\n                \"x\": x,\n                \"y\": y,\n                \"simulation\": \"Ground Truth\",\n                \"noise\": noise,\n            }\n        )\n    for i in range(n):\n        xs = random_x(n_points)\n        ys = noisy_process(xs, noise)\n        for x, y in zip(xs, ys):\n            data.append(\n                {\n                    \"x\": x,\n                    \"y\": y,\n                    \"simulation\": i + 1,\n                    \"noise\": noise,\n                }\n            )\n    return pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n\ndf = simulate_n(4, 2, 0.25)\n# `lmplot` is a fancier version of `regplot` that can handle\n# multiple lines.\nsns.lmplot(\n    df,\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    ci=False,\n    hue=\"simulation\",\n    truncate=False,\n    scatter_kws={\"alpha\": 0.5},\n    facet_kws={\"xlim\": (-1, 1), \"ylim\": (0, 2)},\n)\nMost of these look pretty close to the blue line, the ground truth, but what’s going on with simulation 4? The noise confused the machine learning model. It only has two points to work with and given two points it can figure out a line that perfectly lies on those two points. These two points imperfectly represent the real line and so the machine learned the line of this imperfect representation. And it gets worse with more noise.\ndf = pd.concat(\n    [simulate_n(4, 2, noise) for noise in [0.25, 0.5, 1]]\n)\nsns.lmplot(\n    df,\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    ci=False,\n    hue=\"simulation\",\n    truncate=False,\n    col=\"noise\",\n    scatter_kws={\"alpha\": 0.5},\n    facet_kws={\"xlim\": (-1, 1), \"ylim\": (0, 2)},\n)\nYup, that’s a mess. At noise = 0.5 the lines start to drift from the real line and at noise = 1.0 most of them aren’t even close. But all is not lost, there is a way to learn from noisy data. Use more of it! Let’s try a hundred points per simulation.\ndf = pd.concat(\n    [simulate_n(4, 100, noise) for noise in [0.25, 0.5, 1]]\n)\nsns.lmplot(\n    df,\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    ci=False,\n    hue=\"simulation\",\n    truncate=False,\n    col=\"noise\",\n    scatter_kws={\"alpha\": 0.5},\n    facet_kws={\"xlim\": (-1, 1), \"ylim\": (0, 2)},\n)\nThat’s night and day compared to two data points. Even when noise = 1.0 the machine learning model does a good job of finding the line. This is because there’s more information to learn from and the machine learning model can separate the noise and zero in on the truth.\nThe lesson here is data quality is important, but so is data quantity. Sometimes the answer is a better machine learning model, but that’s not always true, you might just need more data. On the other hand, if you can’t get enough data, you may need better quality data. If you’re stuck with a small amount of low quality data, then machine learning may not be the answer to your problem.",

The original datasets can be found at https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the most important chapters in this book is about cleaning data. It’s a bonus chapter at the end. It walks through the steps and analysis I performed to clean and prepare the dataset for this book. At this point it’s not important. The focus should be on building models as fast as possible and iterating on them. By the end of this book, you should feel comfortable with machine learning, at which point understanding where data comes from and how it’s prepared becomes useful. After all we want to apply te things learned here to the real world, and that starts with real world data.\nIt is still a bonus chapter and not required for understanding machine learning, but I found some suprising things when I cleaned this dataset. If you make it to the end, you really should read it.\n\n\nI’ve taken the liberty of further cleaning the data and making it accessible through a Python API so we can get right to work on machine learning and NLP.\nThis book provides a conda environment file (see the introduction) with everything you need to run the code. If you want to access the dataset without setting up the conda environment, you can get access to it through pip. If you’re just following along through the book website then there’s nothing you need to do.\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/spenceforce/NLP-Simple-to-Spectacular\nLet’s get a feel for the datasets before we move on to machine learning. There are two movie review datasets available. One for classification and the other for unsupervised learning.",

It is intended for benchmarking sentiment classification tasks. Sentiment classification is about predicting the feeling a text conveys. Like emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. In this case it’s predicting whether a review says if a movie is good or bad.\nThis dataset is split into a set for training and a set for testing. We can access both the train and test sets with get_train_test_data, which returns a DataFrame object for each set. The DataFrame class is a staple of pandas. Dataframes are tables and they are not unique to pandas, but pandas is a de facto Python library for working with dataframes. You can think of dataframes as the programmatic version of an excel spreadsheet.\n\nfrom nlpbook import get_train_test_data\ntrain_df, test_df = get_train_test_data()\n\ntrain_df and test_df have the same format, so we’ll just inspect train_df.

There are five columns, three of which have type int64 and two with type object; the object types are strings in our dataframe.pandas assigns the type object to non-numeric values.\nEach row is for one review. A brief rundown of what the columns are:\n\nid: The review ID.\nmovie_id: The movie ID.\nrating: A score from 1-10 that the reviewer gave the movie.\nreview: This is the review. Pretty self-explanatory.\nlabel: A 0 or 1 value indicating if the review is negative or positive, respectively.\n\nThe columns we’re interested in are review, label, and to a lesser extend, rating. review will be the input to all models as this is the natural language we are trying to process. label and rating are what we’re trying to predict! We will mainly be predicting label, but we will also use rating to show how to scale binary classification (predicting two labels) to multiple labels (predicting three or more labels).\nLet’s inspect a few reviews with DataFrame.head().\n\ntrain_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nmovie_id\nrating\nreview\nlabel\n\n\n\n\n0\n7275\ntt0082799\n1\n\"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies\" (1981) i...\n0\n\n\n1\n1438\ntt0397501\n4\nWell!

    "text": "2.1 What is machine learning?\nMachine learning is a field of artificial intelligence focused on algorithms that 1) learn from data and 2) generalize to unseen data. There are three main components to machine learning, data, models, and algorithms. Machine learning models are the things that do the learning and the algorithms direct the models learning. The lines blur at times between models and algorithms and some algorithms only work for some models. At their core, models are functions. They take an input, process them in some way, and return an output. Models have learnable parameters and machine learning algorithms focus on adjusting these parameters to make the model produce better outputs.\nConceptually, models are simple. Take the equation for a line, f(x) = m*x + b. This is a model where m and b are constant values indicating the slope and y-intercept of the line. x is an input value and the output is f(x) = y. If we know m and b we can compute y for any x. If we don’t know m and b, this is where machine learning comes in. Assuming we have a bunch of (x, y) points, a machine learning algorithm can guess what good values for m and b are based on those points. Then we freeze those values and the model can predict y for any x.\nModels can be giant equations and it’s easy to get lost in the details, but remember it’s still just an equation! The learning algorithm will find the right constant terms for us. It’s our job to set up the problem for the algorithm and model and then get out of the way so the machine can learn.",

    "section": "2.2 The simplest of models",
    "text": "2.2 The simplest of models\nTurning our attention back to our model, the simplest thing we can do is predict the same thing for every input. This may seem silly, but it gives us a measuring stick to compare to other models. If we use the latest and greatest techniques in deep learning, it should outperform this model. The only way we’ll know it outperforms it is by building the model and testing it. If it doesn’t outperform this model, that raises cause for concern and the results should be investigated. So we start simple and incrementally improve until we are satisfied.\n\n2.2.1 Train vs. test datasets\nNow that we have a model in mind, we need to train it and test it. While training a model is the fun part, that’s not really what we care about. We want to know how well our model works which is why we have a test set. The test set is used exclusively to benchmark the performance of the model and is not used in the training process. This comes back to making models that generalize to unseen data. Models generally perform better on data they’re trained on because that data is what the model is optimized to predict for. If we use that same data to test the model, then we’ll likely be overconfident in our models predictions. When we deploy the model and it is used on new data it hasn’t seen we’ll be in for a rude awakening. So we separate our dataset into training and testing datasets. In practice care should go into how these datasets are curated, but we won’t worry about that here since I’ve already cleaned our datasets.I highly recommend this blog post on the dangers of blindly splitting your data. It is about validation sets, but the same concepts apply to test sets. It’s ok if some of the content is over your head as we’ll revisit this in a later chapter.\nLet’s train our model to always predict the most common label in the train set and predict the labels of the test set.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom nlpbook import get_train_test_data\n\ntrain_df, test_df = get_train_test_data()\ny_train = train_df[\"label\"]\ny_test = test_df[\"label\"]\npredicted_output = y_train.value_counts().idxmax()\n# `predicted_output` is the most common label in the train set.\npred = np.full(len(y_test), predicted_output)\npred\n\narray([1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1])\n\n\nOur predictions on the test set are all 1 because that’s the most common label in the train set. We will refer to this model as BaselineClassifier. Let’s wrap this up in a class for ease of training and prediction.\n\nclass BaselineClassifier:\n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        \"\"\"Train the model with inputs `X` on labels `y`.\"\"\"\n        # Here we use `numpy` instead of `pandas` since the\n        # input can be any ordered container type.\n        labels, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)\n        self.prediction = labels[np.argmax(counts)]\n        return self\n\n    def predict(self, X):\n        \"\"\"Predict the labels for inputs `X`.\"\"\"\n        return np.full(len(X), self.prediction)\n\n\nbf = BaselineClassifier()\nbf.fit(train_df, y_train)\n(bf.predict(test_df) == pred).all()\n\nnp.True_\n\n\nThe fit method is where the model is trained. This is common lingo in machine learning. We are “fitting” a model to data. Then we predict labels for unseen data with the predict method. When crafting models, best practices are to allow multiple inputs at once. This has two benefits, 1) we only need to make one function call, and 2) we can take advantage of high performance libraries (like numpy) to more quickly train and predict. Our fit and predict methods accept N data points and leverage numpy for speed.\nNow, how do we measure this model’s performance?",

    "text": "2.3 Metrics, metrics, metrics\nMetrics give a sense of how well your model is doing. They allow you to measure and compare models against the same test set. There is no one size fits all metric, and you’ll usually want to look at multiple metrics when evaluating models. I recommend starting with the end when picking metrics. Why are you building this model in the first place? What is it you want the model to do? Then define your metrics with that objective in mind.\n\n2.3.1 Accuracy\nWe are trying to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. We don’t care about positive vs negative, we just care that we get it right. It’s a simple question, “How many predictions are correct?” This is accuracy. It’s measured as a ratio, the correct predictions over all predictions.\n\ndef accuracy(y, y_pred):\n    y, y_pred = np.array(y), np.array(y_pred)\n    return np.sum(y == y_pred) / len(y)\n\nMetrics don’t have to be complicated, and it really just takes one line of Python to calculate. Let’s check the accuracy of our model.\n\naccuracy(y_test, pred)\n\nnp.float64(0.5011190233977619)\n\n\nOur accuracy is 0.5 out of 1.0, which means we got half of the predictions correct. This makes sense since our dataset is half positive and half negative labels, so if we predict 1 for everything we should get half of them correct.\n\n2.3.1.1 Imbalance datasets and accuracy\nMetrics are not foolproof. What is “good” for one dataset may not be for another. This is why we start with the simplest possible model(s). Because it allows us to establish minimum benchmarking values to compare against. Let’s run through an example to show how accuracy changes with the ratio of positive to negative labels in the dataset using our simple models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accuracy of our model is 0.5 when we have a 50/50 ratio of positive to negative labels. As the ratio moves to either extreme however (all ones or all zeros), the accuracy goes up until it reaches 1.0 when all the labels in the dataset are the same.\nIntuitively a higher accuracy is better, but it might not be high because your model works well. It could be that your dataset is imbalanced and your model has figured that out and predicts everything to be the majority class. In that scenario, you end up with a fancy model you put all this effort into just to get the same result as the simple model we just made. How do you combat this? By doing what we’ve done here and start with a simple model. Then as you develop more complex models, they can be compared to this simple model to see if they make improvements.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Other metrics\nAccuracy is not the only thing we can measure, but for simplicities sake it will be the only thing we measure in this book. Other metrics we could look at are F1-score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).",

It also provides a framework to integrate your own machine learning models to leverage all the bells and whistles of scikit-learn. One such benefit is benchmarking. scikit-learn models come with a score method, and the default score method for classifiers is accuracy. By wrapping our model in scikit-learns framework, we get accuracy scores for free.\n\n2.4.1 scikit-learn best practices\nThere’s a pretty lengthy document on developing scikit-learn models, but most of the advice on that page can be boiled down to a few points.\n\n__init__ is for setting attributes, not computation.\nEvery parameter for __init__ should have a corresponding attribute.\nComputation during training that needs to persist across method calls should be assigned to attributes with an underscore suffix.\nThe fit method is for training and the predict method is for prediction.\nfit should return self.\nMust accept N data points at once.\nBaseEstimator should be to the right of scikit-learn mixins.\n\nWith a few tweaks, our BaselineClassifier becomes a scikit-learn model.\n\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin\n\n\nclass BaselineClassifier(ClassifierMixin, BaseEstimator):\n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        \"\"\"Train the model with inputs `X` on labels `y`.\"\"\"\n        labels, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)\n        self.prediction_ = labels[np.argmax(counts)]\n        return self\n\n    def predict(self, X):\n        \"\"\"Predict the labels for inputs `X`.\"\"\"\n        return np.full(len(X), self.prediction_)\n\n\ncls = BaselineClassifier().fit(train_df, y_train)\ncls.score(test_df, y_test)\n\n0.5011190233977619\n\n\nAnd with that we get accuracy for free.

Our dataset includes ratings which we can use as multiclass labels. Fortunately, we’ve written BaselineClassifier to work on an arbitrary number of labels, so we should get multiclass classification for free.

Before trying to predict anything, it’s a good idea to get a sense of what the dataset actually contains. Hopefully the datasets you’re using are well documented. The dataset we’re working with comes with a README which we can see in the directory contents.Don’t worry if the paths shown in this notebook are different from the ones you see on your compute resource. The structure of the data directory should be the same, and by leveraging relative paths with Path objects, everything should just work.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Dataset specifics\nThere are 50k reviews, split into two groups of 25k. One group is for training machine learning models and the other is for testing them. Within each group of 25k, the reviews are split into half positive and half negative.\nThere’s at most 30 reviews for a given movie. The train and test sets have reviews for different movies, so none of the movies reviewed in the train set show up in the test set. Negative reviews have a score of 4 or less and positive reviews have a score of 7 or more.\nThere are an additional 50k reviews without any labels. These reviews are intended for unsupervised learning purposes (we’ll learn about unsupervised learning in the future). There is an equal number of reviews with a score of 4 or less and 5 or more.\n\n\n3.1.2 Directory structure\nThe classification dataset file naming convention is [DATASET]/[LABEL]/[ID]_[RATING].txt where DATASET is one of train or test, LABEL is one of pos or neg (for positive and negative respectively), ID is a numeric identifier for a review, and RATING is the score the reviewer gave the movie.A word of warning for jupyter lab users. Jupyter crashed when I tried to open the directories containing the reviews (like train/pos). My guess is there’s too many files for jupyter to display and it becomes unresponsive. Your mileage may vary.\nThe unsupervised dataset file naming convention is train/unsup/[ID]_0.txt where ID is a numeric identifier for a review.\nURLs to the reviews section are also provided in [DATASET]/urls_[LABEL].txt. The line N refers to ID N in the associated dataset/label combination. For example line 200 in train/urls_pos.txt refers to the reviews webpage for the movie of train/pos/200_10.txt. Here’s an example URL from one of these files: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064354/usercomments. It turns out IMDB has changed their URL format so this link is broken. They now use “reviews” in place of “usercomments” like http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064354/reviews. An oddity in the URLs is they do not point to the individual review, but to the review section of the movie the review is about.By the time you read this, they may have changed the URL structure again",

    "section": "3.2 Question the dataset",
    "text": "3.2 Question the dataset\nAn integral part of building a machine learning model is understanding where the data comes from and how it was acquired. There may be assumptions made during the data curation process that you don’t agree with. An artefact in the data may have unintended side effects downstream, such as training a model that works very well on data it’s seen but performs poorly on data it hasn’t.\nAs you read about the dataset and it’s curation process, I recommend you keep asking “why?” to better understand the choices made during the curation process. Why did they use those specific thresholds for choosing positive vs negative labels? Why that ratio of positive/negative labels? Why that many reviews per movie? Why set up the train/test sets that way?\nIn parallel, also think about how you are going to leverage this data. Your end goal may be different from the curators of the dataset and that should be taken into account as you prepare the data for training machine learning models.\nHere’s a couple questions that come to my mind.\n\nWhy isn’t there a dataset for multi-label classification?\nWhy a maximum of 30 reviews per movie? Why not 10 or 50?\nWhat was the rationale for picking the movies? Was it random or spread evenly by genre?\nWere the movies made during a certain time period?\n\nSome of these questions we could answer ourselves if we want to and they can lead to a richer set of information. IMDB provides an API to programmatically gather movie data over the web. With that tool one can gather movie genres, release dates, associated actors, and more. If we never ask the questions we’ll never think to look. Maybe we curate our own dataset because this one doesn’t provide what we need or it leads to further analysis of the data and the dataset is tweaked based on that analysis. We will stay as true to the source dataset as possible, but don’t let that stop you from thinking about ways to improve this dataset or curate an entirely new one.OMDb API is another API that provides IMDB metadata. I found their service to be much more transparent on pricing and easier to get access to.\n\n3.2.1 Cleaning the data\nThe boundaries between cleaning data and analyzing data can be fuzzy at times, but for sake of simplicity we will only analyze the data as needed to properly clean it.\nThe pieces of information provided in this dataset are:\n\nID\nreview\nrating\nlabel\nmovie ID\n\nThe movie ID isn’t explicitly provided, but we can extract it from the reviews URL which have this format http://www.imdb.com/title/[MOVIE_ID]/usercomments.\nLet’s gather the training set which is under train/pos and train/neg.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef get_review_data(reviews_dir, urls_file):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a `pd.DataFrame` containing the review ID,\n    movie ID, rating, and review.\n    \"\"\"\n    with urls_file.open() as f:\n        movie_ids = {\n            i: url.split(\"/\")[4]\n            for i, url in enumerate(f.readlines())\n        }\n\n    data = []\n    for p in reviews_dir.iterdir():\n        ID, rating = map(int, p.stem.split(\"_\"))\n        data.append(\n            {\n                \"id\": ID,\n                \"movie_id\": movie_ids[ID],\n                \"rating\": rating,\n                \"review\": p.open().read().strip(),\n            }\n        )\n\n    return pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n\ndef get_train_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a `pd.DataFrame` with the supervised training data.\n    \"\"\"\n    dfs = []\n    for label, label_name in enumerate([\"neg\", \"pos\"]):\n        df = get_review_data(\n            data_path / \"train\" / label_name,\n            data_path / f\"train/urls_{label_name}.txt\",\n        )\n        df[\"label\"] = label\n        dfs.append(df)\n    return pd.concat(dfs)\n\ntrain_df = get_train_data()\ntrain_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nmovie_id\nrating\nreview\nlabel\n\n\n\n\n0\n7275\ntt0082799\n1\n\"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies\" (1981) i...\n0\n\n\n1\n1438\ntt0397501\n4\nWell!

Now that we have data in hand to play with, what questions can we answer about it? Maybe we should verify the information provided by the curators of this dataset.\n\nAre there 25k reviews in the train set?\nAre they evenly split between positive and negative?\nIs the max number of reviews per movie 30?\n\nWe can use DataFrame.info() to answer the first question. This method gives some general information about the dataframe, including the column names, number of non-null values in each column, column data types, and the number of rows.Null values include None and NaNs. NaN, or Not a Number, representa a number that is undefined, such as the result of dividing by 0.\n\ntrain_df.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nIndex: 25000 entries, 0 to 12499\nData columns (total 5 columns):\n #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype \n---  ------    --------------  ----- \n 0   id        25000 non-null  int64 \n 1   movie_id  25000 non-null  object\n 2   rating    25000 non-null  int64 \n 3   review    25000 non-null  object\n 4   label     25000 non-null  int64 \ndtypes: int64(3), object(2)\nmemory usage: 1.1+ MB\n\n\nThis dataframe contains 25k entries, and all of those entries have non-null reviews. So the train set does contain 25k reviews. But we know nothing about the quality of these reviews. Are there duplicates? Empty strings? Are some complete gibberish? It’s impossible to qualitatively check every data point, but checking some basic properties of the data can go a long way. I like to call these sanity checks. Let’s start with empty strings.\n\ntrain_df['review'].str.len().min()\n\nnp.int64(52)\n\n\nThe shortest review has 52 characters, so there are no empty reviews. Let’s turn our attention to duplicates. There’s many ways to check this. We’ll use DataFrame.describe.\n\ntrain_df.describe(include=[object])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmovie_id\nreview\n\n\n\n\ncount\n25000\n25000\n\n\nunique\n3456\n24904\n\n\ntop\ntt0374240\nThis show comes up with interesting locations ...\n\n\nfreq\n30\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The movie_id column shows the most frequent movie ID shows up 30 times. So we know there’s at most 30 reviews for a given movie in this dataset.The include=[object] argument tells describe to look at columns with the object data type instead of numeric data types. Strings fall under the object type in pandas.\nThe review column has a count of 25k, but 24,904 unique entries which means there’s 96 duplicate reviews. From a training perspective, it may not make sense to have duplicate items in the train set; odds are we don’t want them, but if they have conflicting labels we may want to keep them after all. Let’s take a peek at them to see if they belong to the same movie and have the same ratings and labels. We’ll create a new dataframe that contains only duplicated reviews.\n\nis_duplicate = train_df[\"review\"].duplicated(keep=False)\nduplicate_reviews = train_df[is_duplicate]\n\nNow that we have the duplicated reviews, let’s dig into them a bit. Are they for the same movie? Do they have the same rating or label?\n\nduplicate_nunique = (\n    duplicate_reviews.groupby(\"review\")\n    .agg(\"nunique\")\n    .head()\n)\nduplicate_nunique.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nmovie_id\nrating\nlabel\n\n\nreview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. What's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. Overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else.\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n.......Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream.

I can remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check this out if you are a fan or curious. He was a riot.\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroupby is grouping rows with the same review column together into their own dataframes. The return value of this operation is a DataFrameGroupBy. This special dataframe type performs operations on each group as if they were their own dataframe instead of all rows in the dataframe. agg performs an operation on the entire dataframe, but since this is a DataFrameGroupBy object, the agg method is applied to each group. In this case it counts the number of unique values in each column for each unique review.\nSome of these reviews have two movie IDs. Let’s inspect the two reviews above that have multiple movie IDs.\n\nis_first2 = duplicate_reviews[\"review\"].isin(\n    duplicate_nunique.index[:2]\n)\nduplicate_reviews[is_first2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nmovie_id\nrating\nreview\nlabel\n\n\n\n\n10893\n985\ntt0223119\n4\n'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film abou...\n0\n\n\n12445\n4102\ntt0118939\n4\n'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film abou...\n0\n\n\n101\n6069\ntt0163806\n8\n.......Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernan...\n1\n\n\n5458\n9319\ntt0043224\n8\n.......Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernan...\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember we are provided a URL for the comments section of each review which is where we extract the movie ID from. This means we can go backwards from movie ID to movie URL. One review is for movies at the URLs http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223119/reviews and http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118939/reviews and the other at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163806/reviews and http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043224/reviews. When I click on each pair one gets redirected to the other. Movie IDs tt0223119 and tt0118939 are for Dead Letter Office, and tt0163806 and tt0043224 are for The Red Skelton Hour. Although they have different movie IDs, they are reviews for the same movie and therefore are truly duplicate reviews. It turns out each movie can have multiple movie IDs; we call this a one-to-many relationship.I checked these links in August 2024. The URL endpoints may have changed in the future.\nWhile it’s not incredibly important, The Red Skelton Hour is actually a TV show. It turns out this dataset contains reviews for movies and tv shows. See what a little digging can turn up?\nWe could check every single movie ID for duplicate reviews manually (or have an intern do it) because it’s possible there are duplicate reviews for different movies, but our task is to predict a label (positive or negative) given a review. Our models don’t need to see the same review over and over again in order to make predictions about them…unless duplicate reviews have different labels! Why would we want to train on both examples in this case? If the same review can be positive or negative, then training a machine learning model with both examples will teach the model to be uncertain about some reviews where the language is more ambiguous.\nLet’s see if there’s any duplicate reviews with multiple labels or ratings.\n\ndifferent_labels = (\n    (duplicate_nunique[\"label\"] &gt; 1)\n    | (duplicate_nunique[\"rating\"] &gt; 1)\n)\nduplicate_nunique[different_labels].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nmovie_id\nrating\nlabel\n\n\nreview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere isn’t, which means these reviews stem from duplicate movie IDs. Since the labels are the same for each duplicate, I feel confident in just removing the duplicate entries. I’ve taken the liberty of performing this analysis on the test set and found the same issue, so we’ll remove duplicates from the test set as well.\n\ndef get_review_data(reviews_dir, urls_file, dedup=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a `pd.DataFrame` containing the review ID,\n    movie ID, rating, and review.\n    \"\"\"\n    with urls_file.open() as f:\n        movie_ids = {\n            i: url.split(\"/\")[4]\n            for i, url in enumerate(f.readlines())\n        }\n\n    data = []\n    for p in reviews_dir.iterdir():\n        ID, rating = map(int, p.stem.split(\"_\"))\n        data.append(\n            {\n                \"id\": ID,\n                \"movie_id\": movie_ids[ID],\n                \"rating\": rating,\n                \"review\": p.open().read().strip(),\n            }\n        )\n\n    rv = pd.DataFrame(data)\n    if dedup:\n        return rv.drop_duplicates(\"review\").copy()\n    return rv\n\n\ndef get_df(dataset, dedup=False):\n    \"\"\"Return a `pd.DataFrame` for a dataset.\"\"\"\n    dfs = []\n    for label, label_name in enumerate([\"neg\", \"pos\"]):\n        df = get_review_data(\n            data_path / dataset / label_name,\n            data_path / dataset / f\"urls_{label_name}.txt\",\n            dedup\n        )\n        df[\"label\"] = label\n        dfs.append(df)\n    return pd.concat(dfs)\n\n\ndef get_train_data(dedup=True):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a `pd.DataFrame` with the supervised training data.\n    \"\"\"\n    return get_df(\"train\", dedup)\n\n\ndef get_test_data(dedup=True):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a `pd.DataFrame` with the supervised testing data.\n    \"\"\"\n    return get_df(\"test\", dedup)\n\n\ntrain_df = get_train_data()\ntrain_df.groupby(\"label\").describe(include=\"object\")[('review', 'count')]\n\nlabel\n0    12432\n1    12472\nName: (review, count), dtype: object\n\n\n\ntrain_df.shape\n\n(24904, 5)\n\n\nWe don’t quite have 25k reviews split evenly across labels, but it’s close enough. I think this is in good shape and we can turn our attention to the test set.\n\ntest_df = get_test_data()\ntest_df.groupby(\"label\").describe(include=\"object\")[('review', 'count')]\n\nlabel\n0    12361\n1    12440\nName: (review, count), dtype: object\n\n\n\ntest_df.shape\n\n(24801, 5)\n\n\nWe’ve removed about 200 reviews from the test set and can start digging in to comparing the test set to the train set.\n\n\n3.2.2 Train-test contamination\nNow let’s talk a bit about what the test set is used for. It’s a separate set of data used to evaluate a machine learning model after it’s trained. It is data used to measure the performance of a model on data it’s never seen before. This is important because when a model is used in production, it will be making predictions about all kinds of inputs it wasn’t trained on and it needs to generalize well beyond the training data. We do not want data leaking from the train set into the test set.\nEasy enough to check.\n\nleak_df = test_df[\n    test_df[\"review\"].isin(train_df[\"review\"])\n]\nleak_df.shape\n\n(123, 5)\n\n\nThere’s 123 reviews from the train set in the test set.\nLet’s think about that for a second. The reviews in the test set should be for movies that aren’t reviewed in the train set, but we have 123 reviews in the test set that are duplicates of those in the train set. How could this happen?\nRemember that we saw duplicate reviews in the train set. This was a result of the same movie having multiple movie IDs. That could explain what’s happening here. Maybe the reviews in both the train and test sets have different movie IDs. We can test that!\n\nboth_df = train_df.merge(test_df, on=\"review\")\n(both_df[\"movie_id_x\"] == both_df[\"movie_id_y\"]).any()\n\nnp.False_\n\n\nBingo, by aligning the reviews with merge() we can directly compare movie IDs for duplicate reviews and none of them are the same. When this dataset was curated, the one-to-many relationship between movies and movie IDs in the IMDB wasn’t accounted for and resulted in not just duplicate reviews in the train and test sets independently, but also leakage of data from the train set into the test set. It gets worse though, we could remove the training reviews that leaked into the test set, but the test set should only contain reviews for movies that aren’t reviewed in the train set. Because of the relationship between movies and movie IDs we have to further process the dataset to see if the movies reviewed in the test set are all different from those in the train set, even after removing duplicates.\nWhy is it important that there are no overlapping movies when the reviews are different? The curators of this dataset give a good explanation in the README they provide,\n\n“In the entire collection, no more than 30 reviews are allowed for any given movie because reviews for the same movie tend to have correlated ratings. Further, the train and test sets contain a disjoint set of movies, so no significant performance is obtained by memorizing movie-unique terms and their associated with observed labels.” (Maas et al. 2011)\n\nOur goal is to train machine learning models that recognize general patterns of language to predict positive or negative sentiment for a given piece of text. If all the reviews in the train set for Batman Begins are positive, the model may learn to associate words like “Batman”, “Bruce Wayne”, “Christian Bale”, and “Christopher Nolan” with positive sentiment. This doesn’t generalize to other movies. If reviews for Batman Begins are in the test set, the model will likely correctly predict those reviews improving it’s performance on the test set. The test set is supposed to be unbiased, but that goes out the window when data from the train set leaks into the test set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are a few forms of data leakage, but what I’ve described here is often called “train-test contamination”. Basically when there’s information specific to the train set that also shows up in the test set. In our case it’s duplicate reviews and movie specific terms. It’s a real problem in machine learning. It can make AI look better than it really is. Finding it in datasets can be tricky, especially as datasets get bigger and bigger. Thought needs to go into preventing sources of leakage and you may never catch every instance of leakage. For example, there’s another instance of leakage that wasn’t considered for this dataset. The train and test sets should contain reviews for a disjoint set of reviewers because individual reviewers may use specific terms or have unique speech patterns that do not generalize to all reviewers and a machine learning model could learn that.\n\n\nFirst we’ll remove the leakage of reviews from the train set into the test set.\n\ndef get_train_test_data():\n    \"\"\"Return train and test `pd.DataFrame`s.\"\"\"\n    train_df = get_train_data()\n    test_df = get_test_data()\n    test_df = test_df[\n        ~test_df[\"review\"].isin(train_df[\"review\"])\n    ].copy()\n    return train_df, test_df\n\nNow, let’s handle the issues that come from the one-to-many relationship of movies and movie IDs. The way movie IDs work in IMDB is there’s one main ID for a movie and other movie IDs for that movie point to the main ID. We saw this earlier when we looked at URLs for duplicate reviews. When you visit those URLs, the duplicate movie ID redirects to the main one. Try it with these URLS, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223119/reviews and http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118939/reviews. Notice how the first link redirects to the second link. That’s because tt0118939 is the main ID for that movie and tt0223119 is a duplicate ID that points to it.\nI’ve taken the liberty of creating a csv file that maps every movie ID in this dataset to their corresponding main movie ID. We’ll use this to replace the movie IDs in our train and test sets then check how many reviews there are per movie and if there’s any overlap of movies between the train and test sets.If you’d like to see details on how I did this check out this README.\n\ndef get_review_data(reviews_dir, urls_file, dedup=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a `pd.DataFrame` containing the review ID,\n    movie ID, rating, and review.\n    \"\"\"\n    with urls_file.open() as f:\n        movie_ids = {\n            i: url.split(\"/\")[4]\n            for i, url in enumerate(f.readlines())\n        }\n\n    movie_id_map = dict(\n        pd.read_csv(\"all_movie_ids.csv\").values\n    )\n\n    data = []\n    for p in (reviews_dir).iterdir():\n        ID, rating = map(int, p.stem.split(\"_\"))\n        data.append(\n            {\n                \"id\": ID,\n                \"movie_id\": movie_id_map[movie_ids[ID]],\n                \"rating\": rating,\n                \"review\": p.open().read().strip(),\n            }\n        )\n\n    rv = pd.DataFrame(data)\n    if dedup:\n        return rv.drop_duplicates(\"review\").copy()\n    return rv\n\nAre there any movies in the original train set with more than 30 reviews?\n\nget_train_data(dedup=False)['movie_id'].value_counts().head()\n\nmovie_id\ntt0235326    32\ntt0169528    32\ntt0171363    30\ntt0187078    30\ntt0049223    30\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nYes there is. And what about in the deduplicated train set?\n\nget_train_data(dedup=True)['movie_id'].value_counts().head()\n\nmovie_id\ntt0118480    30\ntt0023775    30\ntt0049223    30\ntt0277941    30\ntt0284978    30\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nNo there isn’t. So deduplication actually brings the maximum number of reviews per movie down to 30 which was the original intent of this dataset. Let’s repeat this for the test set.\n\nget_test_data(dedup=False)['movie_id'].value_counts().head()\n\nmovie_id\ntt0239496    60\ntt0152015    48\ntt0202381    41\ntt0108915    40\ntt0126810    33\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nBy comparison that’s pretty dramatic. We see one movie with 60 reviews and a couple with over 40!\n\nget_test_data(dedup=True)['movie_id'].value_counts().head()\n\nmovie_id\ntt0365830    30\ntt0373024    30\ntt0365513    30\ntt0079261    30\ntt0086050    30\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nBut it’s the same story when we deduplicate the reviews. It seems the movies with more than 30 reviews are due to duplicate reviews caused by movies with multiple movie IDs. This is good news because the deduplication takes care of the overrepresented movies for us.\nThis leaves one more question about train test contamination though. Are there any movies with reviews in the train and test set?\n\ntrain_df, test_df = get_train_test_data()\ntest_df[\"movie_id\"].isin(train_df[\"movie_id\"]).any()\n\nnp.True_\n\n\nThat is unfortunate. After removing reviews from the test set that appear in the train set, we’re still left with reviews in the test set for at least one movie that is reviewed in the train set. Let’s dig in a little.\n\noverlapping_movies = test_df[\n    test_df[\"movie_id\"].isin(train_df[\"movie_id\"])\n]\noverlapping_movies.shape\n\n(103, 5)\n\n\nThere’s 103 reviews in the test set that shouldn’t be there because their associated movie is reviewed in the train set. How many movies are we talking?\n\nlen(overlapping_movies[\"movie_id\"].unique())\n\n7\n\n\n103 reviews across 7 movies. Let’s also remove these from the test set as they can artificially inflate the benchmarking performance of our models. Instead of removing the duplicate training reviews from the test set, we can filter out reviews with the same movie ID. This will capture duplicates from the same movie.\n\ndef get_train_test_data():\n    \"\"\"Return train and test `pd.DataFrame`s.\"\"\"\n    train_df = get_train_data()\n    test_df = get_test_data()\n    test_df = test_df[\n        (~test_df[\"movie_id\"].isin(train_df[\"movie_id\"]))\n    ].copy()\n    return train_df, test_df\n\n\ntrain_df, test_df = get_train_test_data()\ntrain_df.shape, test_df.shape\n\n((24904, 5), (24576, 5))\n\n\nWe now have 24,904 reviews in the train set and 24,576 in the test set. By removing all reviews from the test set with a movie ID seen in the train set, that should handle duplicate reviews across these groups as well as duplicate movies, but there’s still something wrong with our test set. Our original test set was 25k. We removed 199 duplicate reviews in the test set, then 123 reviews seen in the train set, then 103 reviews with movie IDs seen in the train set. Adding that up doesn’t give us 24,576…\n\n25000 - 199 - 123 - 103\n\n24575\n\n\nOur test set has one to many reviews. That’s because we didn’t actually remove all duplicate reviews in the test set seen in the train set, we just removed the reviews with the same movie IDs. There’s one duplicate review in the train and test sets, it’s just for different movies!\n\ntest_df[test_df[\"review\"].isin(train_df[\"review\"])]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nmovie_id\nrating\nreview\nlabel\n\n\n\n\n10020\n12159\ntt0182766\n8\nThere has been a political documentary, of rec...\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrain_df[train_df[\"review\"].isin(test_df[\"review\"])]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nmovie_id\nrating\nreview\nlabel\n\n\n\n\n355\n10643\ntt0184773\n8\nThere has been a political documentary, of rec...\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out these two movies are part of a documentary series. One documentary ended up in the train set, the other in the test set, and one reviewer happened to write the same review for both. All that’s left is for us to remove the reviews from the test set seen in the train set and the reviews from the test set with movie IDs in the train set.\n\ndef get_train_test_data():\n    \"\"\"Return train and test `pd.DataFrame`s.\"\"\"\n    train_df = get_train_data()\n    test_df = get_test_data()\n    same_review = test_df[\"review\"].isin(train_df[\"review\"])\n    same_movie = test_df[\"movie_id\"].isin(\n        train_df[\"movie_id\"]\n    )\n    test_df = test_df[~same_review & ~same_movie].copy()\n    return train_df, test_df\n\n\ntrain_df, test_df = get_train_test_data()\ntrain_df.shape, test_df.shape\n\n((24904, 5), (24575, 5))\n\n\nNow we have 24,575 reviews in the test set.

Yes, there is more that could be done, like ensuring no reviews from the same reviewer show up in the train and test sets, but we don’t have user IDs associated with these reviews. Besides, the process would look similar to what we’ve already done, just with a little more leg work. For our purpose of learning about NLP this dataset is fine.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and while we’re here I’d like to take a moment to reflect on what we found.\n\nDuplicate reviews in both the train and test sets.\nReviews are for movies and TV shows.\nMore than 30 reviews for some movies.\n\nFortunately these were all duplicate reviews.\n\nTrain-test contamination.\n\nI especially want to draw your attention to the train-test contamination. The amount of contamination in this dataset may be negligible when it comes to benchmarking machine learning models, I don’t really know. But the fact that it’s there and that this dataset is provided by multiple deep learning libraries as well as used for benchmarking tasks in research (Howard and Ruder 2018) should make you pause. I’ve used datasets at face value without questioning them and I guarantee people have taken this dataset at face value. These libraries provide the data as-is. 25k train and 25k test reviews, but we know there’s not really 25k reviews in each set. This is not a critique of the dataset or it’s curators, the libraries that provide it, or the researchers that use it. This is a reminder to verify the data is actually what you think it is because we’ve seen here that it isn’t always what it looks like.Researchers may perform their own preprocessing of the data as we have here. I point to this paper as an example of researchers using the dataset because it is a popular dataset, not as an example of someone using it without preprocessing. In fact, I think this paper is so important it got it’s own chapter.\n\n3.3.1 Keep asking “why?”\nNow that we’ve reached the end, did we answer all the questions we set out to answer?

Algorithms will be implemented in pure python as much as possible. Frameworks will be introduced incrementally where it makes sense.\nThe gimmick behind this book is to walk through implementations of different models using one dataset.
