    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains movie reviews and labels indicating if the review is positive (label 1) or negative (label 0). It is intended for benchmarking sentiment classification tasks. Sentiment classification is about predicting the feeling a text conveys. Like emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. In this case it's predicting whether a review says if a movie is good or bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 50k reviews, split into two groups of 25k. One group is for training machine learning models and the other is for testing them. Within each group of 25k, the reviews are split into half positive and half negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's at most 30 reviews for a given movie. The train and test sets have reviews for different movies, so none of the movies reviewed in the train set show up in the test set. Negative reviews have a score of 4 or less and positive reviews have a score of 7 or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are an additional 50k reviews without any labels. These reviews are intended for unsupervised learning purposes (we'll learn about unsupervised learning in the future). There is an equal number of reviews with a score of 4 or less and 5 or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directory structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification dataset file naming convention is `[DATASET]/[LABEL]/[ID]_[RATING].txt` where `DATASET` is one of `train` or `test`, `LABEL` is one of `pos` or `neg` (for positive and negative respectively), `ID` is a numeric identifier for a review, and `RATING` is the score the reviewer gave the movie.[A word of warning for jupyter lab users. Jupyter crashed when I tried to open the directories containing the reviews (like `train/pos`). My guess is there's too many files for jupyter to display and it becomes unresponsive. Your mileage may vary.]{.aside}\n",
    "\n",
    "The unsupervised dataset file naming convention is `train/unsup/[ID]_0.txt` where `ID` is a numeric identifier for a review.\n",
    "\n",
    "URLs to the reviews section are also provided in `[DATASET]/urls_[LABEL].txt`. The line `N` refers to `ID` `N` in the associated dataset/label combination. For example line 200 in `train/urls_pos.txt` refers to the reviews webpage for the movie of `train/pos/200_10.txt`. Here's an example URL from one of these files: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064354/usercomments. It turns out IMDB has changed their URL format so this link is broken. They now use \"reviews\" in place of \"usercomments\" like http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064354/reviews.[By the time you read this, they may have changed the URL structure again]{.aside} An oddity in the URLs is they do not point to the individual review, but to the review section of the movie the review is about."

    "## Question the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "An integral part of building a machine learning model is understanding where the data comes from and how it was acquired. There may be assumptions made during the data curation process that you don't agree with. An artefact in the data may have unintended side effects downstream, such as training a model that works very well on data it's seen but performs poorly on data it hasn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read about the dataset and it's curation process, I recommend you keep asking \"why?\" to better understand the choices made during the curation process. Why did they use those specific thresholds for choosing positive vs negative labels? Why that ratio of positive/negative labels? Why that many reviews per movie? Why set up the train/test sets that way?\n",
    "\n",
    "In parallel, also think about _how_ you are going to leverage this data. Your end goal may be different from the curators of the dataset and that should be taken into account as you prepare the data for training machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a couple questions that come to my mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why isn't there a dataset for multi-label classification?\n",
    "- Why a maximum of 30 reviews per movie? Why not 10 or 50?\n",
    "- What was the rationale for picking the movies? Was it random or spread evenly by genre?\n",
    "- Were the movies made during a certain time period?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these questions we could answer ourselves if we want to and they can lead to a richer set of information. [IMDB provides an API](https://developer.imdb.com/) to programmatically gather movie data over the web.[[OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) is another API that provides IMDB metadata. I found their service to be much more transparent on pricing and easier to get access to.]{.aside} With that tool one can gather movie genres, release dates, associated actors, and more. If we never ask the questions we'll never think to look. Maybe we curate our own dataset because this one doesn't provide what we need or it leads to further analysis of the data and the dataset is tweaked based on that analysis. We will stay as true to the source dataset as possible, but don't let that stop you from thinking about ways to improve this dataset or curate an entirely new one."

       "      <th>'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. What's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. Overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else.</th>\n",

    "Bingo, by aligning the reviews with `merge()` we can directly compare movie IDs for duplicate reviews and none of them are the same. When this dataset was curated, the one-to-many relationship between movies and movie IDs in the IMDB wasn't accounted for and resulted in not just duplicate reviews in the train and test sets independently, but also leakage of data from the train set into the test set. It gets worse though, we could remove the training reviews that leaked into the test set, but the test set _should only contain reviews for movies that aren't reviewed in the train set_. Because of the relationship between movies and movie IDs we have to further process the dataset to see if the movies reviewed in the test set are all different from those in the train set, even after removing duplicates.\n",

This doesn't generalize to other movies. If reviews for _Batman Begins_ are in the test set, the model will likely correctly predict those reviews improving it's performance on the test set.

It can make AI look better than it really is. Finding it in datasets can be tricky, especially as datasets get bigger and bigger. Thought needs to go into preventing sources of leakage and you may never catch every instance of leakage. For example, there's another instance of leakage that wasn't considered for this dataset. The train and test sets should contain reviews for a disjoint set of _reviewers_ because individual reviewers may use specific terms or have unique speech patterns that do not generalize to all reviewers and a machine learning model could learn that.\n",

    "Ok, we're really done now. Thanks for bearing with me. Cleaning data is probably my least favorite part of machine learning because it can feel like busy work, but it's so important. Even if you leave the dataset the way you found it, it's a great opportunity to learn about the dataset before you do any modeling. I often find that data cleaning is an ongoing process as I build machine learning models because the models can point to oddities in the data I never saw during my initial exploration. You will find article after article about how machine learning works, with little discussion of how the data was prepared. I want you to walk away from this chapter knowing that cleaning data, analysis, and machine learning are all intertwined."
